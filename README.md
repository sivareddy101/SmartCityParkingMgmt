# SmartCityParkingMgmt
This is a project built by SPU student to manage parking within a Smart City


# Problem Statement 
Finding an available parking spot in busy urban areas is a challenging task. In many cases, drivers waste valuable time driving around in circles searching for empty parking spaces, causing traffic congestion, frustration, and wasted fuel. Additionally, parking operators often struggle to manage and optimize their parking lots' occupancy rates due to a lack of accurate and real-time information on empty parking spots.Therefore, the problem of providing reliable and up-to-date information on empty parking spots in parking lots needs to be addressed. This information would help drivers save time and effort while reducing traffic congestion, carbon emissions, and fuel consumption. It would also allow parking operators to better manage their parking lots, optimize their utilization rates, and improve their customers' experience. However, implementing such a system requires robust and accurate technologies, data collection, and analysis tools, as well as effective communication channels with drivers and parking operators
